Postmortem: E-commerce Platform Image Outage (April 12, 2024)

## Issue Summary:

Duration: 3 hours (10:00 AM PST - 1:00 PM PST)
Impact: All product images on our e-commerce platform were unavailable, significantly impacting user experience and potentially leading to lost sales. Approximately 60% of website visitors encountered the image outage during this timeframe.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration during a scheduled database server upgrade resulted in an incompatibility with our image storage service.

## Timeline:

<ul>
  <li>10:00 AM PST: Database server upgrade commences.</li>
  <li>10:15 AM PST: Monitoring alerts trigger, indicating a surge in failed image loads on the e-commerce platform.</li>
  <li>10:20 AM PST: Engineering team investigates and identifies the image loading issue. Initial assumption is a problem with the image CDN (Content Delivery Network).</li>
  <li>10:30 AM PST: CDN provider is contacted, and their investigation reveals no issues on their end.</li>
  <li>11:00 AM PST: The engineering team expands the investigation scope to include the application server and database.</li>
  <li>11:30 AM PST: A code review of the recently deployed database upgrade reveals a configuration error that conflicts with image storage service access.</li>
  <li>12:00 PM PST: The database configuration is reverted to the previous working state.</li>
  <li>12:30 PM PST: Image loading functionality is restored on the e-commerce platform.</li>
  <li>1:00 PM PST: All systems are confirmed operational, and the incident is declared resolved.</li>
</ul>

## Root Cause and Resolution:

<p>
  The root cause of the outage was a configuration error introduced during a scheduled database server upgrade. The new database configuration inadvertently restricted access to the image storage service, preventing the e-commerce platform from retrieving and displaying product images.
</p>

<p>
  The resolution involved reverting the database configuration to the previous working state. This restored communication between the application server and the image storage service, allowing images to be loaded again.</p>

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

<p><b>Improve Code Review Process:</b> Implement a more thorough code review process for database migrations to minimize the risk of configuration errors. This could involve additional reviewers or automated testing specifically focused on configuration changes.</p>
<p><b>Enhance Monitoring:</b> Expand monitoring to include database configuration changes and alerts for potential compatibility issues with other services.</p>
<p><b>Rollback Strategy:</b> Establish a clear rollback strategy for database deployments. This should define procedures for quickly reverting to a known-good configuration state in case of unforeseen issues.</p>
<p><b>Team Communication:</b> Improve communication protocols during incident response. This includes clear escalation procedures and ensuring all relevant teams (database, application, infrastructure) are involved in troubleshooting efforts.</p>
<p>This incident highlights the importance of careful configuration management and robust monitoring practices within a web application infrastructure. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages in the future and ensure a more reliable user experience for our e-commerce platform.</p>
