Postmortem: E-commerce Platform Image Outage (April 12, 2024)

## Issue Summary:

Duration: 3 hours (10:00 AM PST - 1:00 PM PST)
Impact: All product images on our e-commerce platform were unavailable, significantly impacting user experience and potentially leading to lost sales. Approximately 60% of website visitors encountered the image outage during this timeframe.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration during a scheduled database server upgrade resulted in an incompatibility with our image storage service.

## Timeline:

10:00 AM PST: Database server upgrade commences.
10:15 AM PST: Monitoring alerts trigger, indicating a surge in failed image loads on the e-commerce platform.
10:20 AM PST: Engineering team investigates and identifies the image loading issue. Initial assumption is a problem with the image CDN (Content Delivery Network).
10:30 AM PST: CDN provider is contacted, and their investigation reveals no issues on their end.
11:00 AM PST: The engineering team expands the investigation scope to include the application server and database.
11:30 AM PST: A code review of the recently deployed database upgrade reveals a configuration error that conflicts with image storage service access.
12:00 PM PST: The database configuration is reverted to the previous working state.
12:30 PM PST: Image loading functionality is restored on the e-commerce platform.
1:00 PM PST: All systems are confirmed operational, and the incident is declared resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a configuration error introduced during a scheduled database server upgrade. The new database configuration inadvertently restricted access to the image storage service, preventing the e-commerce platform from retrieving and displaying product images.

The resolution involved reverting the database configuration to the previous working state. This restored communication between the application server and the image storage service, allowing images to be loaded again.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve Code Review Process: Implement a more thorough code review process for database migrations to minimize the risk of configuration errors. This could involve additional reviewers or automated testing specifically focused on configuration changes.
Enhance Monitoring: Expand monitoring to include database configuration changes and alerts for potential compatibility issues with other services.
Rollback Strategy: Establish a clear rollback strategy for database deployments. This should define procedures for quickly reverting to a known-good configuration state in case of unforeseen issues.
Team Communication: Improve communication protocols during incident response. This includes clear escalation procedures and ensuring all relevant teams (database, application, infrastructure) are involved in troubleshooting efforts.
This incident highlights the importance of careful configuration management and robust monitoring practices within a web application infrastructure. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages in the future and ensure a more reliable user experience for our e-commerce platform.
